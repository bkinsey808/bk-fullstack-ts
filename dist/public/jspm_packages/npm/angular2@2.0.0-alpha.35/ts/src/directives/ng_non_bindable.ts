import {Directive} from 'angular2/metadata';

/**
 * The `NgNonBindable` directive tells Angular not to compile or bind the contents of the current
 * DOM element. This is useful if the element contains what appears to be Angular directives and
 * bindings but which should be ignored by Angular. This could be the case if you have a site that
 * displays snippets of code, for instance.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * <div>Normal: {{1 + 2}}</div> // output "Normal: 3"
 * <div ng-non-bindable>Ignored: {{1 + 2}}</div> // output "Ignored: {{1 + 2}}"
 * ```
